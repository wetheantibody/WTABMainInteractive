# WeTheAntibody

This is a minimal interactive web application built on p5.js and the p5 libraries scenemanager, accessibility, and play.

## To Use

To start our main website, just clone this repository and open index.html in your preferred browser!

Inside the repository are the main files (pretty much everything except for the example folder). The libraries we are currently using are in the /lib folder. There's not much here yet...we'll fill it with cool stuff soon!

Inside the examples folder are the two folders taken directly from the p5.play library repo and the p5.SceneManager library repos. They have working examples and code, so feel free to poke around in there!
