Okay, so where did all of my friends get that sort of misinformation...
CRASHCOURSE
Holy cow! I didn't know that misinformation came in so many different forms. I gotta teach my friends this stuff for sure...
I'll talk to Drew first. I gotta convince him that pigeons are definitely not spies!
Oh, hey Audrey.
Drew! I really need to talk to you.
Is it about the pigeon thing? I can't believe that you want to bring the government's little spies into our house.
Yes, I definitely wanted to talk to you about that. I thought about your concerns and did some research about it.
Oh man, you're not going to try to change my mind about this, are you?
Well... I thought we could just talk about it. What do you say?
I mean, I guess... I don't know, I feel like you're attacking me.
I don't want to make you feel bad at all, really! I just think that you misunderstood something. You see, pigeons are not government surveillance and I can tell you how.
But look at this post that says so. More than 20k people shared it!
Drew shows Audrey a post he saw on Birdbook.
OPTION
How do you want to talk to Drew about his misunderstanding about pigeons?
Explain that the post he saw was satire (misinformation example option)
Explain that he can verify if a post is true by using critical observation (media literacy example option)
Well, I think you may have misunderstood the intent of the post. Sometimes information is shared because it is meant to be taken as satire. But it's hard to discern nuance online and oftentimes satire turns into fake news that spreads faster and wider than the truth.
So you're saying that this was just a joke? It doesn't seem like it.
I understand your confusion. Why don't we look into some other sources about this topic?
Hmm alright. I'm not super convinced but sure.
Here, I just found an article about this "birds aren't real" phenomenon from the National Audubon Society.
ARTICLE
"The campaign relies on internet-fueled guerrilla marketing to spread its message, manifesting through real-world posters and Photoshopped propaganda tagged with the “Birds Aren’t Real” slogan.
For much of its devoted fanbase, Birds Aren’t Real is a respite from America’s political divide—a joke so preposterous both conservatives and liberals can laugh at it. But for a few followers, this movement is no more unbelievable than QAnon, a right-wing conspiracy theory turned marketing ploy that holds that someone with high-level government clearance is planting coded tips in the news. Therein lies the genius of Birds Aren’t Real: It’s a digital breadcrumb trail that leads to a that leads to a shop full of ready-to-buy merchandise."

Wait — so this was all a joke for a marketing ploy? I had no idea!
Yeah, I was surprised about it too! I have never heard of something like this before.
I just thought that the Facebook post I showed you was the truth. I mean, it just sounded so shocking and groundbreaking!
Yes, that's the intent behind satire. It can definitely be misunderstood.
Whoa... I see. Audrey, I'm so sorry that I shot you down. I feel so bad that I actually believed in this stuff... Heh, now I'm kinda embarrassed.
It's okay, Drew! We can all be wrong sometimes and that's okay. And it's definitely easy to be fooled by the things we see online. It's important to always do some research and look at reputable sources.
Good call. I'll definitely be doing more research in the future. I made a straight up fool of myself online.
It's never too late to fix your mistakes.
Speaking of fixing mistakes — I totally have changed my mind. Audrey, if you want to get a pigeon, I say go for it. I don't have any problems with it anymore.
Really? That's awesome, Drew, thank you so much! I appreciate you hearing me out.
It's no problem, Audrey. Thanks for helping me understand. Go ahead and get that bird!
I'm so excited to! I just need to get Emily and Jack on board with the idea. In fact, I think I'm going to talk to Emily right now.

Well, I think you should take another look at the post. Does it have a link to any sort of article that you could read this about?
Uhh, I guess not.
Maybe the original poster has more information about it on their page. Who posted it?
Oh, I dunno. Looks like "The Verified Reporter."
Well, I have never heard of that news source before. Have you?
No, this is the first time I have seen this source too.
Drew, I'm pretty sure that this is not a reputable source. I think it's a fake news page.
No way...
Does the page have any sourced evidence or articles at all?
Nah, all it has are a bunch of posts with statements like this one.
But I don't get it, so many people shared it..
"Viral" doesn't always guarantee "authentic." Only facts with evidence do. Why don't we look for some actual evidence?
Sure...

Yes, that's the intent behind a lot of fake news sites. They use very shocking statements to try to get people to believe in things that appeal to emotions like outrage.
Whoa... I see. Gosh, I feel silly that I didn't pay attention to all these clues that proved this wasn't real news. Audrey, I'm so sorry that I shot you down. I feel so bad that I actually believed in this stuff... Heh, now I'm kinda embarrassed.
