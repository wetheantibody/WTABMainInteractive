(Woah, I wasn't expecting this kind of reaction from my friends...What should I do?)
(Oh my gosh, why are people so mean?)
(Pigeons aren't government surveillance! And they aren't rats either!)
(My friends are spreading this misinformation like crazy...Pigeons are so misunderstood.)
(They're just birds that need homes!)
(I guess...I guess I can't get this pigeon then. Not when my friends are so upset about it.)
Alright! Looks like this little gal is ready for you to take her home!
"Oh- sorry, but I don't think I can take her home after all. My roommates all freaked out when I told them that I wanted to adopt a pigeon."
What? Oh, no! That's a shame.
Yeah, they were explaining to me some crazy facts about how they think pigeons are government surveillance or gross like rats-
Woah woah woah, those are some pretty nasty rumors. Do they really believe that? Do you believe that?
Well, no, but I don't really know how to change their minds. They are pretty opinionated people.
There is a lot of misinformation about pigeons online. I have been working with these awesome birds for a long time, and I can tell you for a fact that they are not what your friends say they are.
I agree! I think pigeons are super cute!
Maybe you should try to talk to your friends about pigeons. Misinformation today is like a pandemic and it spreads faster and wider than the truth.
I encourage you to research where they got that misinformation and help them understand the truth about pigeons.
Because I know this lil' gal is still going to need a home.
That sounds like a solid plan. I really do want to take this cute pigeon home. I'll talk to my friends and see if I can change their minds. Look out for him for me!
Will do! Good luck!
